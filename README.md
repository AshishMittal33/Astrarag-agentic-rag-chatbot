# 🛰️ AstraRAG — Agentic RAG Chatbot (Production-Grade)

AstraRAG is a production-grade Agentic RAG system, not just a chatbot.
It is a cloud-deployed AI agent capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks using tools, retrieval, and reasoning — while explicitly showing tool usage to reduce hallucinations and increase trust.

The system is designed with scalability, transparency, and real-world deployment in mind.

# ✨ Key Features

🧠 Agentic RAG (not a simple chatbot)

🛠️ Tool-aware AI agent (visible tool usage)

🔎 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🚫 Reduced hallucination via grounded answers

⚡ FastAPI backend for scalability

🎨 Streamlit UI for interaction

🐳 Fully Dockerized application

☁️ Deployed on AWS EC2 (production setup)

# 🧠 How AstraRAG Works

- User submits a complex query

- CrewAI agent plans the task

- Relevant context retrieved using RAG (ChromaDB + LlamaIndex)

- Agent selects and uses tools explicitly

- Tool usage is shown for transparency

- Final response is generated by Groq LLM

- Answer is grounded and less prone to hallucination

# 🐳 Docker & Production Deployment

- Entire application is Dockerized

- Backend (FastAPI) and UI (Streamlit) run as services

- Deployed on AWS EC2

- Environment variables managed securely

- Production-ready setup using uvicorn

- This mirrors real-world AI SaaS deployment patterns.

#🚀 Run Locally

1. pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Create a .env file:

  GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


3. Run backend:

  uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


4. Run UI:

  streamlit run ui.py

# ☁️ Deployment

- Dockerized application deployed on AWS EC2

- Backend served via FastAPI + Uvicorn

- UI exposed via Streamlit

- Suitable for scaling and future service separation
